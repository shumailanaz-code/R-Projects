# 📊 Gender Parity and Female Enrollment Rate Analysis in Developing Countries

## 📖 Project Overview

This research project focuses on analyzing the **Gender Parity Index (GPI)** and **female enrollment rates** at 
**primary** and **secondary education levels** in **developing countries**. The goal is to statistically evaluate 
educational equity across genders, examine trends over time, and forecast future values using advanced statistical techniques.

The analysis was conducted using **R language in RStudio**, leveraging various statistical and predictive modeling techniques.

## 🎯 Research Objectives

1. **Descriptive Analysis**  
   - Examine GPI and female enrollment rates across primary, lower secondary, and upper secondary education levels.

2. **Correlation Analysis**  
   - Assess the correlation between female enrollment rates at different education levels.  
   - Evaluate GPI correlation across all levels.

3. **Hypothesis Testing**  
   3.1. Determine if there is a significant difference in the **average female enrollment rate** between education levels.  
   3.2. Test whether the **difference in GPI** between lower and upper secondary levels is statistically significant.

4. **Regression Analysis**  
   - Analyze the relationship between **primary GPI** and **enrollment rates** of both genders.  
   - Predict the **average primary GPI** for the year **2016** using regression models.

5. **Forecasting and Time Series Analysis**  
   - Forecast **primary GPI** and **primary female enrollment rate** using time series modeling to aid future educational planning.
